# high-score-game
Python console application that tracks and stores high scores with voice feedback using text-to-speech.
# High Score Game

A Python-based console application that generates a random score, compares it with a previously stored high score, and updates the record using file handling. The application also provides voice feedback using text-to-speech for enhanced user interaction.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates the practical use of core Python concepts such as random number generation, file handling, conditional logic, and integration of external libraries. The high score is stored persistently, ensuring data is retained across multiple executions.

---

## Features

- Random score generation
- Persistent high score storage using a text file
- Automatic high score comparison and update
- Voice feedback using text-to-speech
- Clean and beginner-friendly Python code

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `random` module
- `os` module
- `pyttsx3` (Text-to-Speech library)
